Abstract
Bicycle sharing systems are emanating as secondary injunction form of transportation now
a days. Jobike is an on demand bike sharing service which gives everyone the opportunity
to make short trips easily within the coverage area. Spatio-temporal models arise when
data are collected across time as well as space and has at least one spatial and one temporal
property. Here we show the spatio-temporal analysis of bicycle system based on agent-based
modeling. In ABM multiple agents are interacting. Cyclists use the jobike when they need.
For attaining cycles in their needs, an initial prediction helps them by knowing the existance
of cycles which is done by autonomous agent. This analysis gives a clear view about jobike
distribution in specific area. As a result the bicycle availability is increased. Using spatio-
temporal analysis of Jobike movement finishes with the result of bicycle distribution in
various place at the end of the day.
